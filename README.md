# EagleDash-CIS3060 Background
CIS 3060 Project, Spring 2021 at California State University, Los Angeles

# Description
This project involves developing a report that is centered around a dedicated food delivery service that only caters to Cal State LA students, professors, and other faculty members. The purpose of this project is to create a system with the use of a use-case model and several other types of UML diagrams that will visually support the readersâ€™ understanding of the project. Furthermore, this project defines the process of using the food delivery service and how other entities contribute to the process itself.

# Additional Information
Aside from the final project report, the other files are my contributions to the project. There are two types of files: PNG (an image) and draw.io (diagrams editable in draw.io) files.
